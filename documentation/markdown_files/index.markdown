## HotDoc documentation

Hotdoc is a documentation framework. It provides an interface for
extensions to plug upon, along with some base objects (formatters, ...)

Hotdoc is distributed with a set of extensions that perform various tasks,
such as parsing C and extracting symbols with `clang`, parsing
`gobject-introspection` (gir) files, highlighting the syntax of code snippets
with `prism`, etc.
